# ScreenCap

Fork of https://github.com/npocmaka/batch.scripts/blob/master/hybrids/.net/c/screenCapture.bat

Modified to capture the client area instead of the window of the application. 
Compiled as .NET application instead of self-compiling batch file (which compiled to the current/working directory every time).

Can be referenced and used within other .NET applications also.
